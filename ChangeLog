* Thu Feb 07 2019 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 6.11.0
- update lwes library
- added a more robust mondemand.conf file parser

- don't print out info about flushing, instead just keep a metric.
- better unit test coverage

* Thu Apr 20 2017 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 6.8.1
- avoid webmachine dependency

* Tue Mar 21 2017 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 6.8.0
- add user state to the mondemand_statdb:map function so that you can do
the equivalent of mapfold there.
- alter flushing to use an initial state function
- added a convience function for adding contexts to events which support
them to mondemand_event.

* Mon Mar 06 2017 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 6.7.0
- generalize flush functionality so that the server can plug in a slightly
modified version.
- cleanup some config, all application config should be read only in
mondemand_config

* Fri Feb 03 2017 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 6.6.1
- make sure that mondemand vmstats metrics are not emitted without a full
interval having gone by.  This means a restart of a service can lead to
a gap in vmstats, but that's better than the spikes which can happen without
waiting (IMHO).

- add scheduler utilization to vmstats

* Thu Oct 06 2016 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 6.5.0

- add a call to get all event names

- now able to post traces over 65kb
- updated the version of lwes dependency

* Tue Aug 02 2016 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 6.3.0
- fix median calculation where there is only one sample (since this is
ill defined, it will be set to zero)
- add fetch_sample_set/4 to allow fetching a sample set from a previous
minute

* Fri Jun 10 2016 Tim Whalen (whalen) 6.2.1
- moved max_metrics constant to mondemand_config so we can tweak at runtime

* Thu Jun 09 2016 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 6.2.0
- added a function to convert from millis since epoch to erlang:now/0
format

* Wed Jun 01 2016 Tim Whalen (whalen) 6.1.0
- when sending stats emit multiple lwes events when num_metrics is large

* Thu May 12 2016 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 6.0.0
- significantly improved performance when deserializing stats events
- improved coverage of mondemand_statsmsg as well as mondemand_event
- removed some unused fields from currently unused records, but since they
were in the public header

* Fri Feb 26 2016 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.8.0
- significantly improved performance when deserializing performance events
- improved coverage of mondemand_perfmsg module

* Fri Feb 05 2016 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.7.1
- minor dialyzer issue

* Fri Feb 05 2016 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.7.0
- add annotation message support
- add accessors for performance messages
- fix for R15B port calls

* Fri Dec 04 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.6.0
- add port count and limit to vmstats

* Thu Dec 03 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.5.2
- syntax_tools needs to be in the required apps

* Mon Nov 23 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.5.1
- performance trace deserialization was broken

* Wed Oct 28 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.5.0
- vmstats can now be sent once a minute via mondemand when specified in the
application config file.  A program id is required so a minimal config
might be something like
{ vmstats, [ { program_id, mondemand } ] }
in addition a context could be added via a context parameter with a
2-tuple list as an argument like
{ vmstats, [ { program_id, mondemand }, {context, [{foo,bar}]} ] }

* Tue Oct 27 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.4.2
- problem with context deserialization

* Fri Oct 09 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.4.1
- missing file in 5.4.0 release, as well as some additions to the
performance tracing event.  Added contexts and a caller_label

* Thu Oct 08 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.4.0
- support performance messages as well as allowing sending of different
events to different channels.

* Fri Sep 18 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.3.1

* Thu Aug 20 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.3.0
- allow more than one previous minute to be kept

* Mon Jul 13 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.2.0
- allow host sent in events to be overriden by an application env variable
and stored in a global (copied mochiglobal into the mondemand application).
- added collect_time which is the time that statsets were collected.

* Fri Jul 18 2014 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.1.0
- added interface for gauges
- cap counters to max signed int64 as that's what lwes is doing
- allow for multiple configs in config file to emit to multiple servers
- added an mondemand_stats module which centralizes operations around stats
- added statset which collects samples in a reservoir and emits a
configurable amount of statistics each emit interval

* Fri Mar 14 2014 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 5.0.0
- serialization of events now happens in calling process instead of while
sending
- make send_interval an application variable so you can change it from 60
seconds if you want
- mondemand:stats/0 now adds context when it's available
- trace messages now always use dicts internally to better match other
languages implementations

* Wed Feb 19 2014 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 4.1.1
- updated dependency on version of lwes

* Fri Feb 14 2014 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 4.1.0
- added a mondemand:stats/0 function to pretty-print stats
- updated dependency on version of lwes

* Mon Mar 28 2011 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 4.0.0

to be set when sending stats
- fix bug with context num

* Wed Jan 26 2011 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 1.2.0
- initial version, originally in another non-public repo, so versioning
reflects an upgrade from that version
